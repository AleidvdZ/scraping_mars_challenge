### Module 11 Challenge

## About
This challenge is to demonstrate web data scraping from two different web sites using Splinter and Beautiful Soup.  The deliverables are the following:

Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.

from: https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html 

Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.

from https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html
